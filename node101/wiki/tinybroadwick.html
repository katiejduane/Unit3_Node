        She was nicknamed 'Tiny', as she weighed only 85 pounds (39&#160;kg) and was 5 feet

    <p>Born to parents George and Emma Ross on April 8, 1893, <b>Georgia Ann Thompson</b> weighed in at
        only 3 pounds. The last of seven daughters, Georgia was given the nickname "Tiny" due to her
        small size.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>At the age of 15 she saw <a href="/wiki/Charles_Broadwick" title="Charles Broadwick">Charles
            Broadwick</a>'s World Famous Aeronauts <a href="/wiki/Parachuting" title="Parachuting">parachute</a>
        from a hot air balloon and decided to join the travelling troupe. She later became Broadwick's
        adopted daughter. Although she would eventually make her jumps from an airplane, in her earlier
        career she was jumping from balloons. Billed as "the doll girl," Tiny began performing aerial
        skydives and stunts while wearing a "life preserver" designed by her adopted father. On
        December 28, 1908, Tiny made her very first jump out of a hot air balloon.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a
                href="#cite_note-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The skydiving family
        traveled around and performed at fairs, carnivals, and parks. The appeal of the Broadwick
        Flying troupe, according to Tiny, was that "it was a very neat and fast act."<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a
                href="#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>Among her many other achievements, she was the first woman to parachute from an airplane, which
        she is credited with accomplishing on <a href="/wiki/June_1913" title="June 1913">June 21, 1913</a>,
        over Los Angeles, with aviator <a href="/wiki/Glenn_L._Martin" title="Glenn L. Martin">Glenn L.
            Martin</a> as the pilot.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>
        However, she previously made at least two jumps from Martin's plane during an exhibition in
        Chicago's Grant Park the week of September 16, 1912.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>
        These early jumps included a well-publicized
        jump on January 9, 1914, from a plane built and piloted by Martin, 1,000 feet over <a href="/wiki/Griffith_Park"
            title="Griffith Park">Griffith Park</a> in <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California" class="mw-redirect" title="Los Angeles, California">Los

            id="cite_ref-lat070728_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-lat070728-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-encwo_9-0"
            class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-encwo-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> She was also the first
        woman to parachute into water.
    </p>
    <p>In 1914, she demonstrated parachutes to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army" title="United States Army">U.S.
            Army</a>, which at the time had a small, hazard-prone fleet of aircraft. The Army,
        reluctant at first to adopt the parachute, watched as Tiny dropped from the sky. On one of her
        demonstration jumps, the <a href="/wiki/Static_line" title="Static line">static line</a> became
        entangled in the tail assembly of the aircraft, so for her next jump she cut off the static
        line and deployed her chute manually, thus becoming the first person to jump <a href="/wiki/Free-fall" class="mw-redirect"
            title="Free-fall">free-fall</a>. This demonstrated that pilots could
        escape aircraft by using what was later called a <a href="/wiki/Ripcord_(skydiving)" title="Ripcord (skydiving)">ripcord</a>.<sup
            id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>By the time of her retirement from jumping in 1922, she was said to have made over 1,100 jumps.
        Although she was not a pilot, she was one of the few female members of the <a href="/wiki/Early_Birds_of_Aviation"
